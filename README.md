# Config-Backupper
This script can backup the configs from firewalls and switches.


### Packet dependencies
Check the file **REQUIREMENTS** to see all packet dependencies.

# How to install 
Step 1. ``` git clone https://github.com/MrMarioMichel/Config-Backupper ```  --> this branch should work otherwise download one of  the [newest release](https://github.com/MrMarioMichel/Config-Backupper/releases)

Step 2. ```cd ./Config-Backupper``` --> enter the downloaded repository

Step 3. ```chmod 700 ./setup.sh``` --> make the setup.sh executable

Step 4. ```./setup.sh``` --> start the setup.sh

# How to setup

#### Set days after a config gets compressed (.gz format) [2,5x-3,5x SMALLER] (Numbers only):

Here you can define (in days) when the archived configs get compressed*. (Recommended : 14)


#### Set days after a config gets deleted (Numbers only):

Here you can define (in days) when the archived configs get deleted*. (Recommended : 90)


#### Set days after a logs gets compressed (.gz format) [2,5x-3,5x SMALLER] (Numbers only):

Here you can define (in days) when the archived logs get compressed*. (Recommended : 14)


#### Set days after a logs gets deleted (Numbers only):

Here you can define (in days) when the archived logs get deleted*. (Recommended : 90)


*If you don't want to deleted/commpress the configs/logs is set it to 9999. --> No compression/deletion for 27 Years long enough...

#### Enter bit lenth (Numbers only):

Here you can define the SSH Key used to authenticate at the devices. (Recommended : 4096 or higher)

Use low bit key length (1024 - 2048bits) to speed up the authentication **BUT SECURITY SUFFERS FROM IT !!!**.

#### Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

Just press enter otherwise the script would need everytime it connects to a devices the password. Still want to have a password you will neeed to enter the password in clear text in the ./Modules/Backup module ```sshpass -p "<PASSWORD>" scp -i ...```

#### Enter same passphrase again:

Again just enter.

# How to configure

## Server side

In ./Devices/<VENDOR>/<VENDOR>-Devices.txt you need to enter line by line all IP addresses. For more information have a look in any of these device .txt files.

## Client side (Network device)

Create or use an existing read only profile for a user named "backup" (All in small letters, all togther, no spaces) on the device. This user should get only read rights for highest security. Also add the ./SSH-Keys/Backup-SSH-Key.pub to the user that this key pair can be used to login. See table **Use SSH-Key for Authenictaion** how to do that for each vendor.

### Use SSH-Key for Authenictaion

# How to test 

You can test the script (Recommended) befor you run it automaticaly to get the config file with ```scp -P <PORT> -vvv -i ./SSH-Keys/Backup-SSH-Key backup@><IP>:<CONFIGFILE>  ./TestConfigFile```. If that worked and the config file is now stored as **TestConfigFile**. You can delete the **TestConfgiFile** and run the script and see what happens.

### Remote name of the config file

# About 

The script uses a <YOU-CHOOSE-IT> bit long SSH Key for authentication. That key must be added to all devices at the user backup in order for the script to get the configs. In the directory ./Log will be all output generated by the script for each day and each vendor.
  
  # Limitaions
  | LimitNr        | Limitation           | Reason  | Will get fixed | 
| :-------------: |:------------- | :----- | :-----: |
| 1  |  If you try to run the scrip more often than once a day the logs of the secound run will also be in the same log file  | Logging has not been designed for this  |
| 2  | If you try to create a bigger SSH-Key than 16384 bit it will not work tue to limitations  | There is a limit for the max key lenght in ssh-keygen if the key bits exceeds the of maximum 16384 |

# Facing Problems

### General :

| Problem     | Solution  |  Description | 
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- |
| ssh: connect to host <IP-ADDRESS> port 22: Connection timed out | Check if port 22 used for SSH  | If SSH do not use the port 22 (Default) you need to place the host inside the special module of the certain vendor (Problem caused by scp because it automaticaly uses port 22 if no other port is defined) |

### Fortinet :

| Problem     | Solution  |  Description | 
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- |
| Sink: 501-Permission Denied 501-Permission Denied | Check if enabled SCP on the Fortinet Device | The script can connect but has problems with the rights to copy the config file. If you don't enable SCP you can run into this problem. |
